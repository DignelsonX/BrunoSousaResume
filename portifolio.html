        SecurePass is a safety companion app designed for contractors working in hazardous environments. Once signed in, the app automatically detects when the user enters a designated hazard zone using geofencing technology and begins real-time location tracking. In case of an emergency, users can quickly request help by performing a long press on the emergency button (previously triggered by shaking the phone). SecurePass also features a built-in heart rate monitor that continuously sends vital information to the management dashboard, helping supervisors stay informed about workers‚Äô safety and well-being.
